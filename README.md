### The Problem

Users with disabilities often have higher energy bills due to their reliance on energy-intensive medical equipment, assistive technology, and home modifications. In fact, households containing an adult with a work-disability require, on average, 28 percent more income to obtain the same standard of living as a comparable household without a member with a disability ([source](https://www.nationaldisabilityinstitute.org/reports/extra-costs-living-with-disability/)).

### Target Audience

We will be focusing on users in lower-income communities. Because of their financial situation, they typically live in buildings with less integrated system to control the environment of the whole building for energy management. Therefore, we want to focus on creating a platform for individual household and help them manage energy consumption and reduce cost.

### Method

To solve the problem, we are planing to use machine to predict energy consumption. Because we want to give more power to end-user, we will create an app that give residential users access to energy consumption forecasting data, and provide suggestions on how to use appliances off-peak to save bills.

**Accessibillty**

We will build the app to meet WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) and provide voice command and text-to-speech to accommodate for users with motor disabilities.

Universal Design: Incorporate principles of universal design into your solutions, such as designing spaces that are accessible and usable by people of all abilities.
